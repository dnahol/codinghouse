// Arithmetic Game
// Using Vanilla JavaScript, build a math game with randomly made math problems.
// Users select an answer by clicking number buttons that appear below the
// equation. The numbers that are clicked appear in an answer box following
// the = sign in the equation.
//
// MVP:
//
// Have two random integers (max and min is up to you).
// Show a + sign between them, to signal an addition problem.
// Have 10 digit buttons, numbered 0-9.
// Use a submit button to submit answer.
// Use a clear button to clear your current answer.
// If your answer is wrong, show the actual answer.
// Deployment:
//
// Commit to Github, and have your app working on GitHub Pages.
// Extra Features:
//
// Use either + or - to build an equation (you may need to account for negative numbers).
// Use a skip button to skip the question and show the answer.
// Add a scoring system. Change the score based on if the question was answered correctly, answered wrong, or skipped.
// In addition to + and -, include * and / (multiply and divide).
// For division, make sure that the answer isn't a decimal.
// Alternatively, add a decimal button, an allow answers that include decimal values.
// Have keyboard input for the numbers, as well as the buttons.
// Add victory and failure sound effects.
// Have some form of animation.
